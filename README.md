# Complex-Data-Projects
This repository contains 3 assignments of Complex Data Managment course.

## Assignment 1
Histograms are used by database systems for the approximate representation of the distribution of values in table fields. They can assist in the approximate estimation of the output of common operators (such as selection). In this assignment,histograms are created and used to estimate the number of results for selection operators. In the folder of the first assignment you will find all the necessary code, datasets and report.
## Assignment 2
The goal of this assignment is to develop spatial data indexing using the grid technique and then efficiently search the data.
## Assignment 3
The goal of this assignment is to develop an algorithm for top-k queries, which aggregate individual scores of objects from three sources. The objects could be restaurants, each source a review website (e.g., Google, TripAdvisor, Yelp), and the individual score of an object from a source is the average of the ratings the restaurant received on that specific website. Note that there's some error in the code, some sequential accesses are not being read properly, so the output is not always correct.
